These are the **minimum required features** for your polling system to work correctly and securely.

## **1. User (Voter) Registration & Login**

* Voter can request to become a candidate
* Admin approves candidates
  → Needed for generating the ballot options.

---

## **3. Create an Election (Admin)**

## **4. Voting Process**

* Voter enters voterId to vote
* Ballot shows approved candidates
* Voter selects a candidate
* Vote is **hashed** and stored **without voterId**

## **6. Declare Results**
